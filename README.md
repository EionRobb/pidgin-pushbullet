# Pushbullet plugin for Pidgin

Lets you (currently) send/receive SMS from your Android phone to/from Pidgin

The plugin is a work in progress and is a bit rough around the edges at the moment, but for now use your Access Token from https://www.pushbullet.com/#settings/account as your password

Build on Linux using ```make && sudo make install``` (you'll need libjson-glib-dev, glib-2.0-dev and libpurple-dev packages)

Dll download available from http://eion.robbmob.com/libpushbullet.dll (if you have't downloaded one of my plugins before, download the [json-glib library](https://github.com/EionRobb/pidgin-opensteamworks/raw/master/steam-mobile/libjson-glib-1.0.dll) into your Program Files (x86)\Pidgin folder (or Program Files\Pidgin), NOT into the plugins folder)
